# Tom - My javaScript sandbox

Tom is a little node app that I wrote to learn, explore, and play with JavaScript, express.js,
pug, real-time monitoring, simulation, plotting etc.

It's a little sandbox for me to play in. Some things may or may not work and it may or may
not break your system ;)

# Running the app

Describe how to install and run the app.
